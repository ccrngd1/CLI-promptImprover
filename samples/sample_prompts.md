# Sample Prompts for Testing

## Educational Content

### Hybrid Mode (Simple)
"Explain quantum computing in simple terms for a high school student"

### LLM-Only Mode (Complex)
"Develop a comprehensive curriculum module that explains quantum computing principles through progressive complexity levels, starting with classical computing limitations and building up to quantum superposition, entanglement, and practical applications, with interactive examples and assessment questions for high school students"

## Technical Documentation

### Hybrid Mode (Straightforward)
"Write a comprehensive guide for setting up a Python development environment"

### LLM-Only Mode (Complex)
"Create a detailed technical architecture document that explains the design decisions, trade-offs, and implementation strategy for a microservices-based Python application, including containerization, service mesh configuration, monitoring, and deployment pipelines, targeted at senior software architects"

## Creative Writing

### Hybrid Mode (Simple)
"Write a short story about a robot learning to paint"

### LLM-Only Mode (Complex)
"Craft a multi-layered narrative that explores the philosophical implications of artificial consciousness through the metaphor of a robot's journey to understand art, incorporating themes of creativity, identity, and the nature of beauty, while maintaining literary depth and emotional resonance"

## Business Communication

### Hybrid Mode (Standard)
"Draft a professional email to decline a meeting request politely"

### LLM-Only Mode (Complex)
"Compose a strategic communication plan for announcing a major organizational restructuring to multiple stakeholder groups (employees, customers, investors, partners), ensuring consistent messaging while addressing specific concerns and maintaining trust and transparency throughout the transition"

## Code Generation

### Hybrid Mode (Direct)
"Create a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence efficiently"

### LLM-Only Mode (Complex)
"Design and implement a comprehensive algorithmic solution for dynamic programming optimization problems, including the Fibonacci sequence as a case study, with detailed explanations of time and space complexity analysis, multiple implementation approaches, and performance benchmarking methodology"

## Data Analysis

### Hybrid Mode (Basic)
"Explain how to perform exploratory data analysis on a customer dataset"

### LLM-Only Mode (Complex)
"Develop a complete data science methodology framework for customer behavior analysis that includes data quality assessment, feature engineering strategies, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning model selection criteria, and business impact measurement, with specific recommendations for different industry verticals"

## Domain-Specific Examples (Best for LLM-Only Mode)

### Healthcare
"Create a comprehensive patient education protocol for diabetes management that addresses cultural sensitivity, health literacy levels, and personalized care plans while ensuring medical accuracy and regulatory compliance"

### Legal
"Draft a detailed analysis of intellectual property implications for AI-generated content, including current legal precedents, regulatory gaps, and recommendations for corporate IP strategy in the age of generative AI"

### Finance
"Develop a risk assessment framework for cryptocurrency investments that incorporates traditional financial analysis, blockchain technology evaluation, regulatory compliance considerations, and portfolio diversification strategies"

### Academic Research
"Construct a literature review methodology for interdisciplinary research that bridges computer science and cognitive psychology, including systematic search strategies, quality assessment criteria, and synthesis approaches for conflicting findings"
