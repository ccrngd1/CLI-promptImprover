# Prompt Extraction Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The orchestration tool was only displaying the first line of optimized prompts instead of the complete multi-line refined prompts.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the regex patterns used to extract content from LLM responses. The patterns included `\n\n` (double newline) as a stop condition, which caused extraction to stop at the first empty line encountered, resulting in only the first line being captured.

**Problematic Pattern:**
```regex
r'OPTIMIZED PROMPT[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
```

This pattern would stop at the first `\n\n` (empty line), which often occurs right after section headers in structured prompts.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `orchestration/engine.py`
**Fixed prompt extraction:**
```python
# Before
r'OPTIMIZED PROMPT[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'

# After  
r'OPTIMIZED PROMPT[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
```

**Fixed synthesis reasoning extraction:**
```python
# Before
r'SYNTHESIS REASONING[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nORCHESTRATION|\nOPTIMIZED|\Z)'

# After
r'SYNTHESIS REASONING[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nORCHESTRATION|\nOPTIMIZED|\Z)'
```

**Fixed orchestration decisions extraction:**
```python
# Before
r'ORCHESTRATION DECISIONS[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nOPTIMIZED|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'

# After
r'ORCHESTRATION DECISIONS[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nOPTIMIZED|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
```

### 2. `agents/llm_enhanced_refiner.py`
**Fixed fallback patterns:**
```python
# Before
fallback_patterns = [
    r'improved prompt[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nIMPROVEMENTS|\nBEST PRACTICES|\Z)',
    r'refined version[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nIMPROVEMENTS|\nBEST PRACTICES|\Z)',
    r'optimized prompt[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nIMPROVEMENTS|\nBEST PRACTICES|\Z)'
]

# After
fallback_patterns = [
    r'improved prompt[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nIMPROVEMENTS|\nBEST PRACTICES|\Z)',
    r'refined version[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nIMPROVEMENTS|\nBEST PRACTICES|\Z)',
    r'optimized prompt[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nIMPROVEMENTS|\nBEST PRACTICES|\Z)'
]
```

**Fixed improvements extraction:**
```python
# Before
improvements_patterns = [
    r'IMPROVEMENTS MADE[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nBEST PRACTICES|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)',
    r'improvements[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nBEST PRACTICES|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)',
    r'changes made[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nBEST PRACTICES|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
]

# After
improvements_patterns = [
    r'IMPROVEMENTS MADE[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nBEST PRACTICES|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)',
    r'improvements[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nBEST PRACTICES|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)',
    r'changes made[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nBEST PRACTICES|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
]
```

### 3. `agents/llm_enhanced_validator.py`
**Fixed critical issues extraction:**
```python
# Before
r'CRITICAL ISSUES[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nRECOMMENDATIONS|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'

# After
r'CRITICAL ISSUES[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nRECOMMENDATIONS|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
```

**Fixed recommendations extraction:**
```python
# Before
r'RECOMMENDATIONS[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\n\n|\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'

# After
r'RECOMMENDATIONS[:\s]*\n(.*?)(?=\nCONFIDENCE|\Z)'
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
- **Multi-line prompt**: Only 1 line, 38 characters extracted
- **Result**: "# Academic Paper Summarization Request" (header only)

### After Fix:
- **Multi-line prompt**: 15 lines, 600 characters extracted  
- **Result**: Complete structured prompt with all sections, formatting, and requirements

## Impact

### âœ… **Benefits:**
1. **Complete Prompt Display**: Users now see the full optimized prompts with all sections and formatting
2. **Better User Experience**: No more confusion about truncated or incomplete results
3. **Improved Debugging**: Full content visibility helps understand agent improvements
4. **Accurate Evaluation**: Complete prompts enable proper assessment of optimization quality

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements:**
1. **Robust Pattern Matching**: Patterns now correctly handle structured content with empty lines
2. **Consistent Extraction**: All agents now use consistent, reliable extraction logic
3. **Better Content Preservation**: Multi-line formatting and structure preserved
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Reduced false positives from premature pattern matching

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to APIs or data structures
- Existing prompts and responses continue to work
- Enhanced extraction is transparent to users

## Usage
When running the orchestration tool, users will now see complete optimized prompts including:
- Full structured content with headers and sections
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Multi-line formatting and spacing
- Complete requirements and guidelines
- All improvements and enhancements made by agents

The fix ensures that the sophisticated prompt improvements generated by LLM agents are fully visible to users, providing complete transparency into the optimization process.
