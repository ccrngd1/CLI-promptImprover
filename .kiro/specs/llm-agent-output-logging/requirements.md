# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing logging system to provide detailed visibility into LLM agent outputs across all LLM-enhanced agents (LLMAnalyzerAgent, LLMRefinerAgent, LLMValidatorAgent). Currently, the system logs orchestration decisions and performance metrics, but lacks detailed logging of what each LLM agent actually outputs, making debugging and monitoring of LLM interactions difficult.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the prompt optimization system, I want to see detailed logs of what each LLM agent outputs, so that I can understand how the LLM is processing prompts and identify issues in LLM responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM agent processes a prompt THEN the system SHALL log the raw LLM response with agent identification
2. WHEN an LLM agent parses the response THEN the system SHALL log the parsed structured data
3. WHEN an LLM agent extracts specific components THEN the system SHALL log what was extracted and any parsing issues
4. WHEN an LLM agent calculates confidence scores THEN the system SHALL log the confidence calculation details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring the prompt optimization service, I want structured logging of LLM interactions, so that I can track LLM usage patterns, response quality, and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging LLM outputs THEN the system SHALL include session ID, iteration number, and agent name for traceability
2. WHEN logging LLM responses THEN the system SHALL include token usage, model information, and processing time
3. WHEN logging parsed responses THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores and extraction success indicators
4. WHEN logging fails THEN the system SHALL log error details and fallback behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a prompt engineer analyzing system behavior, I want to see the reasoning and analysis that LLM agents provide, so that I can understand the quality of LLM-generated insights and improve system prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM analyzer processes a prompt THEN the system SHALL log the analysis reasoning and extracted insights
2. WHEN an LLM refiner generates improvements THEN the system SHALL log the refinement reasoning and applied techniques
3. WHEN an LLM validator assesses quality THEN the system SHALL log validation reasoning and identified issues
4. WHEN LLM agents provide suggestions THEN the system SHALL log the suggestions and their priority rankings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting LLM integration issues, I want configurable logging levels for LLM outputs, so that I can control the verbosity of LLM logging without affecting other system logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring logging THEN the system SHALL support separate log levels for LLM agent outputs
2. WHEN LLM logging is set to DEBUG THEN the system SHALL log all LLM interactions including raw prompts sent
3. WHEN LLM logging is set to INFO THEN the system SHALL log processed outputs and key metrics
4. WHEN LLM logging is set to WARNING THEN the system SHALL only log LLM errors and fallback usage
