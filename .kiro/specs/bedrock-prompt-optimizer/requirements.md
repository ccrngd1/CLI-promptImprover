# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a lightweight Python application that helps engineers iteratively improve prompts for Amazon Bedrock. The system uses multiple AI agents to collaborate on prompt optimization through cycles of refinement, execution, evaluation, and user feedback. The application leverages the Amazon Bedrock SDK to test prompts against real models and provides a structured workflow for continuous prompt improvement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want to input an initial prompt and have multiple LLM-powered AI agents collaborate to improve it through intelligent judgment and orchestration, so that I can quickly optimize prompts for better performance on Amazon Bedrock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an initial prompt THEN the system SHALL accept the prompt input and initiate the LLM-driven collaborative improvement process
2. WHEN the improvement process starts THEN the system SHALL engage multiple specialized LLM agents, each with domain-specific system prompts and best practices
3. WHEN agents collaborate THEN the system SHALL use LLM-based orchestration to coordinate their interactions and synthesize their recommendations into an improved prompt version
4. WHEN agents analyze prompts THEN each agent SHALL leverage LLM capabilities with specialized system prompts containing prompt engineering best practices
5. IF the user provides context about the prompt's intended use THEN the system SHALL incorporate this context into each agent's LLM-based analysis and improvement process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want the system to execute my prompts against Amazon Bedrock models, so that I can see how they perform in real scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is ready for testing THEN the system SHALL execute it using the Amazon Bedrock SDK
2. WHEN executing prompts THEN the system SHALL support multiple Bedrock model types and configurations
3. WHEN a prompt execution completes THEN the system SHALL capture the model's response and execution metadata
4. IF a prompt execution fails THEN the system SHALL capture error details and provide meaningful feedback
5. WHEN executing prompts THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits and authentication properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want the system to automatically evaluate prompt performance using LLM-based judgment, so that I can understand how well my prompts are working through intelligent, context-aware analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt execution completes THEN the system SHALL automatically evaluate the response quality using specialized LLM evaluator agents
2. WHEN evaluating responses THEN the system SHALL use LLM-powered analysis with multiple evaluation criteria including relevance, clarity, completeness, and prompt engineering best practices adherence
3. WHEN evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL provide quantitative scores and qualitative feedback generated through LLM reasoning and judgment
4. WHEN evaluating THEN the system SHALL use LLM agents to compare performance against previous prompt versions and identify specific improvements
5. WHEN LLM evaluators assess quality THEN they SHALL use system prompts containing evaluation best practices and domain-specific criteria
6. IF evaluation criteria are customizable THEN the system SHALL allow users to define domain-specific evaluation metrics that are incorporated into LLM evaluator system prompts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want to provide feedback on prompt performance and have the system incorporate it into the next iteration, so that the improvement process aligns with my specific needs and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluation results are presented THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for feedback
2. WHEN a user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL accept both structured ratings and free-form comments
3. WHEN user feedback is received THEN the system SHALL incorporate it into the next improvement cycle
4. WHEN starting a new iteration THEN the system SHALL consider all previous feedback and evaluation results
5. IF a user is satisfied with the current prompt THEN the system SHALL allow them to finalize and export the optimized prompt

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want the system to maintain a history of prompt iterations and their performance, so that I can track improvement over time and revert to previous versions if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new prompt iteration is created THEN the system SHALL save it with version information and timestamps
2. WHEN storing iterations THEN the system SHALL include the prompt text, evaluation scores, user feedback, and execution results
3. WHEN a user requests history THEN the system SHALL display all iterations with their performance metrics
4. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL allow users to compare different versions side by side
5. IF a user wants to revert THEN the system SHALL allow selection of any previous iteration as the starting point for new improvements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want the multi-agent system to use LLM-based orchestration with embedded best practices, so that the agents can make intelligent decisions and provide high-quality prompt improvements based on proven techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are initialized THEN each agent SHALL be configured with specialized system prompts containing prompt engineering best practices and domain expertise
2. WHEN the orchestrator coordinates agents THEN it SHALL use LLM-based decision making to determine agent execution order, conflict resolution, and consensus building
3. WHEN agents provide recommendations THEN the orchestrator SHALL use LLM reasoning to synthesize multiple agent outputs into coherent improvement suggestions
4. WHEN best practices are applied THEN agents SHALL incorporate established prompt engineering techniques such as chain-of-thought, few-shot examples, role definition, and clear instruction formatting
5. WHEN agents encounter conflicts THEN the LLM orchestrator SHALL analyze the disagreements and make reasoned decisions about which recommendations to prioritize
6. IF new best practices are discovered THEN the system SHALL allow updating agent system prompts to incorporate improved techniques

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want a simple command-line interface to interact with the prompt optimization system, so that I can integrate it into my existing development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clear command-line interface
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support commands for starting new optimization sessions, viewing history, and configuring settings
3. WHEN running optimization cycles THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and status updates
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL format output in a readable and actionable way
5. IF configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support configuration files for Bedrock credentials and model preferences
